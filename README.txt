My name is Ethan Bonney and I am a Computer Engineering student here at Suny New Paltz.

My photo is attatched in the repo under Ethan_Bonney.jpg

I have studied Computer Engineering here at SUNY New Paltz for 4 years now so I have a large variaty of languages I am comfortable in. Some of which include Java, ARM Assembly, C, C++,
VERILOG, python, and now some HTML. Most of my projects have been centered around microcontrollers such as a traffic light controller and a cruise control system. I have also made an alarm
clock in VERILOG. microcontrollers and Embedded Systems have been my favorite classes I have taken so far but I have always been better at the software side so I have taken all of 
my tech electives in Computer Science classes such as Intro to Data Science and CS 3.

In my opportunities I have had in the work force, developers told me that it is crucial to know HTML and JavaScript for any software based job now a days and it looks really good on 
a resume either way. I hope this class will open up more opportunities for when I am out of college so I can find a job that interests me.
